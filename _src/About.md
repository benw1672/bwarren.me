# About me

**Hi, I'm Ben Warren.**

I'm a software engineer based in Seattle. I recently graduated from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), where I did my bachelor's in Materials Science and Engineering, and my master's in Computer Science. At the moment, I'm basically a generalist engineer, but I'm particularly interested in methods in AI/ML and programming languages that improve engineering efficiency and reduce error.

I love to follow my intellectual curiosity, and look forward to blogging about the cool things I learn along the way :).
